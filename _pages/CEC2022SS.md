**Evolutionary Machine Learning for Planning and Scheduling**

The IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence 2022, 18 July - 23 July 2022, Padua, Italy

**Overview**

Planning and scheduling are important optimisation problems that reflect the practical and challenging issues in real-world applications such as order picking in warehouses, the manufacturing industry, robotics and grid/cloud computing. However, it is non-trivial to find good solutions for planning and scheduling problems efficiently, especially for large scale and dynamic planning and scheduling problems. Evolutionary machine learning such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, artificial immune systems, particle swarm optimisation, differential evolution, neural network, and evolutionary reinforcement learning has been successfully and widely used to learn/select/construct solutions/heuristics for the planning and scheduling problems. In addition, a number of machine learning techniques such as surrogate, feature selection, and multitask learning have been successfully used to improve the quality of learned heuristics/solutions efficiently. With the growth of high-tech and high-value manufacturing, cloud computing facilities, and robotics industry, researchers in this field have to continuously face new challenges, which requires innovative approaches for planning and scheduling.

This special session focuses on both practical and theoretical aspects of evolutionary machine learning approaches to planning and scheduling for different kinds of application tasks. Novel approaches that use machine learning techniques for solving different planning and scheduling problems are highly encouraged. Examples of machine learning techniques include surrogate, feature selection, and multitask learning. This special session focuses on using evolutionary machine learning techniques to learn heuristics/solutions for the planning and scheduling problems.

We welcome the submissions of high-quality papers that effectively use evolutionary machine learning to handle the planning and scheduling problems. Papers with analyses and innovative algorithm designs to handle challenging issues in planning and scheduling problems are also highly encouraged.
