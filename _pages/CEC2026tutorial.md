**Genetic Programming and Machine Learning for Scheduling**

The IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2026)/IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2026), 21-26 June 2026, Maastricht, the Netherlands

**Tutorial Abstract**

Scheduling is an important optimisation problem that reflects the practical and challenging issues in real-world scheduling applications such as order picking in warehouses, the manufacturing industry and grid/cloud computing. Job shop scheduling (JSS) is a typical scheduling problem, which covers a full range of topics and tasks including static JSS, dynamic JSS, flexible JSS, dynamic flexible JSS, from basic research to a huge number of realworld industrial applications.

Instead of manually designing scheduling heuristics and algorithms for each problem, we can use machine learning and hyper-heuristics to automatically learn effective scheduling heuristics from low-level heuristics, characteristics of scheduling problems, and dynamic
information from production environments. Among the techniques studied and applied within the research field of JSS, genetic programming (GP), a powerful evolutionary machine learning technique, has been successfully used to learn scheduling heuristics for JSS,
especially for dynamic JSS. Although GP has shown its advantage in learning scheduling heuristics for JSS, GP still has several limitations for handling JSS such as high computational cost and large search space.

This tutorial will provide a comprehensive introduction to evolutionary machine learning techniques for JSS. This tutorial will cover different types of (advanced) evolutionary machine learning approaches for JSS. From this tutorial, you are expected to get familiar with evolutionary machine learning in four aspects. First, you will learn the definition of hyper-heuristic learning with a comparison of heuristic learning. Second, the details of JSS (e.g., static, dynamic, flexible JSS) will be given. Third, how to use GP as hyper-heuristic
approaches to learn heuristics for JSS will be introduced with examples. Last, this tutorial will show how to use advanced machine learning techniques such as feature selection, surrogate and multitask learning with GP to JSS. All the techniques mentioned will be introduced with promising results.
