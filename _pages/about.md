Biography
======
Fangfang Zhang (Member, IEEE) is a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence with the Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence & School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington. She received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, in 2014 and 2017, and 2021, respectively. Her PhD thesis received the ACM SIGEVO Dissertation Award, Honorable Mention, and IEEE CIS Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award. She has over 70 fully refereed publications, including the top journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, and IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, and received Best Paper (Runner-up) Awards on top/major EC conferences such as GECCO, EuroGP and AJCAI. Her current research interests include evolutionary computation, hyper-heuristic learning/optimisation, job shop scheduling, surrogate and multitask learning. She is an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, Expert Systems with Applications, and Swarm and Evolutionary Computation. She is a Vice-Chair of the IEEE Task Force on Evolutionary Scheduling and Combinatorial Optimisation. She has organised a number of special sessions and tutorials in international conferences such as IEEE CEC and SSCI. She is the Vice-Chair of IEEE New Zealand Central Section. In addition, she is the Secretary of the AI Researchers Association in New Zealand.
