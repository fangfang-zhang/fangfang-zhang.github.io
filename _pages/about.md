Biography
======
Fangfang Zhang (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, in 2014 and 2017, respectively. She is currently a research fellow in computer science with the School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand. She has over 25 journal and conference papers. Her current research interests include evolutionary computation, hyper-heuristic learning / optimisation,
job shop scheduling, and multitask learning. Miss Zhang is a member of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and Association for Computing Machinery, and has been severing as reviewers for top international journals such as the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation and the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, and conferences including the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference and the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation. She is also a committee member of the IEEE NZ Central Section.
