**Special Session on Evolutionary Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimisation**

EAI BICT 2022 - 14th EAI International Conference on Bio-inspired Information and Communications Technologies

1-2 August 2022, Chengdu, China

**Aim and Scope:**

Combinatorial optimisation, such as scheduling and resource allocation for cloud/grid/high-performance computing, has attracted attention from both academics and the industry due to its practical value. Evolutionary machine learning, e.g., evolutionary computation techniques, has been widely used to handle combinatorial optimisation problems. Instead of manually designing heuristics for a specific problem instance, evolutionary machine learning has also been successfully used as hyper-heuristics approaches to select or generate heuristics for a class of problem instances, especially in dynamic problems, such as learning scheduling heuristics for dynamic job shop scheduling.

This special session focuses on both practical and theoretical aspects of evolutionary machine learning approaches to combinatorial optimisation for different kinds of application tasks. Novel approaches that use machine learning techniques for solving different combinatorial optimisation problems are highly encouraged. Examples of machine learning techniques include surrogate, feature selection, and multitask learning. This special session focuses on using evolutionary machine learning techniques to learn heuristics/solutions for the combinatorial optimisation problems.

We welcome the submissions of high-quality papers that effectively use evolutionary machine learning to handle the combinatorial optimisation problems. Papers with analyses and innovative algorithm designs to handle challenging issues in combinatorial optimisation problems are also highly encouraged.
